## Top-down and Bottom up methods 

THe top-down method. is a system where analysts they use census data of population in certain areas to then convert it into population counts in a gridded geospatial covariate 
which is used to determine how populated specific areas of geolocations are. BY. doing this. they can find which areas of poopulation to study and go to during specifc events. 
For example, data analysts used this top-down method during the ebola outbreak to determine which areas were infected and which were more
at risk during the outbreak due to higher populations in the area or poor living situations and other 
factors that could influence the spread of the disease. One of the big problems however is that it is hard
to use the top-down approach, analysts need an accurate census to portray this data and in low-income countries more often than not, 
the census for those countries are not up to date which makes it harder 
to accuratley portay a gridded population.
The bottom up approach is similar to the top-down approach in it's goal but it
uses a different type of population count to graph the data.
The bottom up approach uses micro census surveys which is a survery conducted in small areas 
which account for the entire population in that small area. This method is alot cheaper since the micro
census surveys are only a fraction of the coat of a full census. They then use this data 
to predict the population in locations of that country that are not sampled. An example of 
the bottom-up method is to use to find the ruggedness of terrain.
