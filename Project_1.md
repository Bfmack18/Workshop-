# Project 1: Sri Lanka 

Brody Mack 

## Subdivisions of Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka, officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia, located in the Indian Ocean to the southwest of the Bay of Bengal and to the southeast of the Arabian Sea. This country is made up of 9 different provinces which are then subdivided into 25 different districts. 

The main problem I encounterd during this project was not the coding, but getting Rstudio to work comfortably on my laptop and not causing it to take days to finish running a simple 5 lines of code.
