Scale - the size of the global map take by a satelite  
Dissagregation- seperating the data into smaller groups so the data isn't put into one giant group
admisnistrative areas- certain  areas  under a governments control  
grid cells/ Ratsters- lines on a map that are used to distinguish and locate and certain areas. 
uniform distribution- equally distributing something along a certain space.
Proportionate allocation

In the LLoyd article they are attemptimg to estimate the global population by 2050 and where they will live and how much space will be consumed by these extra people.
In order to estimate first how many people there are they use the global census in order to take an estimate of how manny more people will be living in the world in 10 years. 
Next they use a special type of GIS to recognize each certain area like Africa adn Asia where the population will be growing. 
By using a mosaic set-up with aggregation they are able to and also with a raster, they are able to seperate the land of these areas into layers
to distinguish what type of land it is, what the climate is, and the amount of people who ive there already from houses or signs of human life. 
Also by setting it up into layers, these researchers can estimate the future population and also predict the land they will use for the future generations that will need their space to live when population increases.
